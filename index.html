                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>Do you find your life to be tedious and boring? Do you wish to live a new life that suits your desires? The BitLife game will help you do that!</p>
                            <p>While it's still a fun game, many features are now locked behind a paywall, including options that were previously free. Additionally, there are so many ads that it's difficult to click on anything without being interrupted. I understand that ads are a way to generate revenue, but it feels excessive, especially considering how much money the game already makes.</p>

                            <h2>What You Should Know About BitLife</h2>
                            <p>BitLife is a life simulation game where users take control of a stranger's life from beginning to end. Released by Candywriter, it may not be well-known on Google Play, but it has made a significant impact on the gaming community. BitLife allows users to explore various life paths, whether majoring in acting or considering what to do in old age, through a series of choices, random events, and humor.</p>
                            <p>The game has simple gameplay similar to other simulation games. However, in BitLife, you choose actions for each character's age instead of selecting dialogue. For example, at age 18, you can decide whether to study in college or join the army.</p>
                            <p>Characters have four basic stats: health, happiness, appearance, and intelligence. In my opinion, health is the most important factor because it enables you to take on more activities. You can enhance your appearance with makeup, clothing, accessories, or even plastic surgery. Your intelligence can be increased through education. However, a wrong decision can lead to dire consequences, including run-ins with the law.</p>

                            <h2>How to Play BitLife</h2>
                            <h3>Starting Out</h3>
                            <p>You begin BitLife in a random country with parents assigned to raise you. As an infant, your options are limited to seeing a doctor. As you age, the world opens up; at four, you can spend time with your parents or ask for money, and you start elementary school at six.</p>
                
                            <h3>Key Life Stages</h3>
                            <p>The age of eighteen is pivotal, as your decisions will significantly affect your future. Beyond education, you can join the military or work part-time to earn money and gain experience. Every future event hinges on your choices.</p>

                            <p>As you grow older, managing finances becomes essential. You can spend your money on vehicles, real estate, start a business, or gamble at the casino. Touch "Assets" on the Main Menu to manage your wealth, but note that you must be of legal age to own property.</p>

                            <p>A standout feature of BitLife is the ability to find love. You can choose your sexual orientation before starting the game, helping you discover that special someone. Even in marriage, challenges can arise. Making wise decisions is crucial to maintain a happy family.</p>
                            <p>Spending quality time with your partner can lead to a fulfilling relationship, complete with children, vacations, and cherished memories as you both approach your golden years.</p>

                            <p>You'll navigate various life aspects during the game. If your happiness dips too low, you may feel depressed. Poor health choices can lead to severe consequences. The game mimics real life in many ways; making good choices helps you thrive, while negative choices can land you in trouble.</p>
