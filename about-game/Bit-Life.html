        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Do you find your life to be tedious and boring? Do you wish to live a new life that suits your desires? The BitLife game will help you do that!</p>
        <p>While it's still a fun game, many features are now locked behind a paywall, including options that were previously free. Additionally, there are so many ads that it's difficult to click on anything without being interrupted. I understand that ads are a way to generate revenue, but it feels excessive, especially considering how much money the game already makes.</p>

        <h2>What You Should Know About BitLife</h2>
        <p>BitLife is a life simulation game where users take control of a stranger's life from beginning to end. Released by Candywriter, it may not be well-known on Google Play, but it has made a significant impact on the gaming community. BitLife allows users to explore various life paths, whether majoring in acting or considering what to do in old age, through a series of choices, random events, and humor.</p>
        <p>The game has simple gameplay similar to other simulation games. However, in BitLife, you choose actions for each character's age instead of selecting dialogue. For example, at age 18, you can decide whether to study in college or join the army.</p>
        <p>Characters have four basic stats: health, happiness, appearance, and intelligence. In my opinion, health is the most important factor because it enables you to take on more activities. You can enhance your appearance with makeup, clothing, accessories, or even plastic surgery. Your intelligence can be increased through education. However, a wrong decision can lead to dire consequences, including run-ins with the law.</p>
